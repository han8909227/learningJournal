#Learning Journal Day 10
<hr />

<h2> Progress </h2>

Today I learned about wire framing, it has proven to be useful on the day 10 lab which is to construct & style a web page using existing images. I was able to build a wire frame for the page based on the structure I've initially drawn out. Once the wire frame is completed I was able to push in images directly, to complete the web page simply had to adjust image sizes to the wire frame block pixels or vice versa.

<h2>Thoughts & feelings </h2><br>
I wish I knew about wire framing techniques when building the salmon cookie front page, it would've been more structured and organized compare to what I did, which was building the structure and style from top to bottom.
