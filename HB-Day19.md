<h2> Progress </h2>
<p>
Today we presented our project, before that we tried our game many times trying to find any bugs that could pop up during the game.
Overall I think my team did a great job at making sure that every detail on the game page or any other page has been considered, (i.e sizes, color, game function under different circumstances). It has been a informative session of 201 course, I have gained more knowledge in a month than any other month I spend in school, I appreciate all the help from our TAs, peers and the instructor!
