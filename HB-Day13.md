<h2> Progress </h2>
<p>
<br>
Today I've learned how to store and extract data or sets of data into local storage on the browser, it is very useful in terms of functionality, and in increasing user friendlyness of a web page. 

Overall I have more insight on the data structure locally, and how my browser caches data and how we can access them through JS.

<h2>Thoughts & feelings </h2><br>
<p>
I hope to learn more about data structure and the means/tool that is used to transfer/interpret data between user and the server.
