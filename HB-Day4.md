# Learning Journal Day 4

Today I learned:
<ul>
<li>using for loop to re-iterate over an array of string or numbers</li>
<li>use function to store commends which can be called upon once the function is called</li>
<li>the importance of code modularity and organization</li>
<li>more css layout ... (positioning)</li>

Today is our first day of peer programming, I paired up with John who is a good coder. We paired up to drive each other's code 1 at a s time, it was much more efficient than doing it alone. When doing navigating I was able to have a clear mind and speak out purely what my logic were and not have to worry about syntax aspect of the code. We had issues with GitHub not being able to accept our push when it detects the other person has tempered with the file, which we have learned and know not to do...

Overall it was a productive day of learning and working together
