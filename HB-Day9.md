<br>
This week's learning experience has been exciting! The tools we've learned this week made JS coding easier and more efficient.
Stuff like constructor function and objects are fun to use with, it makes sense now how event can be handle by JS.

<h2>Thoughts & feelings </h2><br>
I definately felt the learning curve earlier the week, but as I felt on my face countless times I am comfortable with constructing objects and handling events.
