TIL how to properly structure a html page, using <h> & <p> also change their properties by declaring a "id" or "class" with them. (Can also be done by assign class or id to <div>). This made it much clear to me how css knows which part to style on the html code. Perhaps the best thing I learned today was ACP, knowing how to add, commit and push files onto GitHub was crucial and handy.

We worked on a project that requires the minimum amount of styling, I build a site containing my resume. I used JS to asked the user a series of questions to check if they see me as a qualified programmer.
