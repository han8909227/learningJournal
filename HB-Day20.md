<h2> Progress </h2>
<p>
Today marked the end of our 201 course, since we are not starting 301 right away I am planning to make good use of this gap period. The instructor mentioned code war, a platform where coders can move up their status by finishing code challenges. I plan to try out some of the problems for two reasons, one is to get a head start since we are required to do this on 301 another is to keep a coding mindset during this period.
