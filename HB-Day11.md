#Learning Journal Day 10

<h2> Progress </h2>
<p>
<br>
Today I learned how to assign sources and alt for images elements by using Javascript, and also utilizing what we have learned so far i.e constructor function, event listener/handler, element rendering methods, etc to do a project.

<h2>Thoughts & feelings </h2><br>
I really need to work on planning my codes or code structure before typing in anything, otherwise I will get lost after finish one function that I had in mind and will have no idea what's next. Having a sense of the whole picture should give a better guidance toward making something with multiple functions/values and making it relatively organized the first time.
