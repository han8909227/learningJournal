#Learning Journal Day 17
<hr />

<h2> Progress </h2>
<p>
Since the last journal we have started project week, our project is to make a casino version of the war card game. <br />
Technical wise I have learned NOT to use same variable i for all the loops in my script especially when it's getting very long. Because I had an instance when I call a function inside a loop, both of that function and the loop uses i variable. As one can imagine that just messes up the i value when the function finishes execute and goes back to the loop. </br>
Team work wise I have became a better team mate by constantly checking with my team as I progress in my part, for an example I would check with the guys what id they were going to use for the HTML element that user name goes into, so I won't put an different id to the user name rendering function I created. By doing so we were able to avoid troubles in naming and variable problem when joining our parts.
