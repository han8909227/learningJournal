Object help organized properties in a single function making them easy to access, however it is a totally different world
using constructor functions to generate objects, multiple object declaration can be avoided and objects can be stored in a single
array to be easily manipulated. For an example we can generate a table or a list containing certain array values or properties stored inside a object, which are stored inside an array. Very handy!

<h2>Thoughts & feelings </h2><br>
<p>
I thought making web pages involves web developer typing out every html element and gives it a value or a directory, but it seems like one can generate most of html codes used in web page (list and tables) simply by using JavaScript. Which makes me feel a little better about writing html, however I am still not very comfortable at CSS. To elaborate I often cannot format each elements to their appropriate padding, margin, width, etc that will place them where I want them to be, I get confused by properties of parent elements when try to format child elements. I most certainly need more practice on layout and styling.
